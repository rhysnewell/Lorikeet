Installation
========

## Option 1: Install static binary 
#### Recommended
You can make use of the precompiled static binaries that come with this repository. You will have to install the lorikeet
conda environment using the lorikeet.yml. This will also install the latest `dev` branch of the `flight` submodule which 
is necessary to perform strain genome recovery.
```
GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 git clone --recursive https://github.com/rhysnewell/Lorikeet.git;
cd Lorikeet;
conda env create -n lorikeet -f lorikeet.yml;
conda activate lorikeet;
cd flight;
git checkout dev;
pip install .
```

Once you have created the conda environment download and install the latest release file from github. Please make sure
you are installing the latest release by checking what is available in the release tab of GitHub, as I'm often slow to update
this README when changes occur.
```
wget https://github.com/rhysnewell/Lorikeet/releases/download/latest/lorikeet-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl-v0.6.0rc8.tar.gz;
tar -xvzf lorikeet-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl-v*.tar.gz;
cp release/lorikeet $CONDA_PREFIX/bin;
cp release/remove_minimap2_duplicated_headers $CONDA_PREFIX/bin;
```

## Option 2: Build manually
You may need to manually set the paths for `C_INCLUDE_PATH`, `LIBRARY_PATH`, `LIBCLANG_PATH`, and `OPENSSL_DIR` to their corresponding
paths in the your conda environment if they can't properly be found on your system. This method also assumes you have 
previously installed rust via rustup on your system. The conda version of rust currently seems to be broken, so system 
versions need to be used for installation.
```
GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 git clone --recursive https://github.com/rhysnewell/Lorikeet.git;
cd Lorikeet;
conda env create -n lorikeet -f lorikeet.yml; 
conda activate lorikeet;
pip install --upgrade cmake;
bash install.sh # or run without installing e.g. `cargo run --release -- genotype -h`;
lorikeet genotype -h
```

Depending on your local network configuration, you may have problems obtaining Lorikeet via git.
If you see something like this you may be behind a proxy that blocks access to standard git:// port (9418).

```
$ GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 git clone --recursive git://github.com/rhysnewell/Lorikeet.git
Cloning into 'Lorikeet'...
fatal: Unable to look up github.com (port 9418) (Name or service not known)
```

Luckily, thanks to this handy tip from the developer of [Freebayes](https://github.com/ekg/freebayes) we can work around it.
If you have access to https:// on port 443, then you can use this 'magic' command as a workaround to enable download of the submodules:

```
git config --global url.https://github.com/.insteadOf git://github.com/
```

## Option 3: Conda 
#### *Only for version <= 0.5.0* (Not yet recommended)

*NOTE:* The conda version is often a few commits and/or versions behind the development version. If you want the most
up to date version, follow the instruction in option 2. 

Install into current conda environment:
```
conda install lorikeet-genome
```

Create fresh conda environment and install lorikeet there:
```
conda create -n lorikeet -c bioconda lorikeet-genome && \
conda activate lorikeet
```
