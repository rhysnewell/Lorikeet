/**
 * Given a {@link MultiIntervalShard} of {@link GATKRead}, iterates over each {@link AssemblyRegion} within

 * regions.
 *
 * Loads the reads from the shard as lazily as possible to minimize memory usage.
 *
 * This iterator represents the core of the {@link AssemblyRegionWalker} traversal.
 *
 * NOTE: the provided shard must have appropriate read filters set on it for this traversal type (ie., unmapped
 * and malformed reads must be filtered out).
